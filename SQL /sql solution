The following query will provide the positive and negative lables by:
   sorting all rows in desc order of scores to get 1 as weak lable
   picking all rows where the modulus(row_number,3) =1 i.e 1, 4, 7...
   then finding cumulative count from begining of the result
   then extracting only first 10,000 rows
   repeating the same for asc order of scores to get 0 as weal lable
   unioniong the result 
   finally ordering by image_number
  

select
 	image_id, 
  	weak_label
from
(
  	select
      		image_id, 
      		case when mod(sorted_score_order,3) = 1 then 1 end as weak_label,
      		count() over (order by sorted_score_desc_order ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND current row) as cum_count
  	from (
    			select
    			row_number() over (order by scores desc) as scores_desc_order,
    			image_id,
    			score
    			from 
    				image_scores
  	)	as table_1
   	where 
		cum_count = 10000 and weak_label =1

union all

select
		image_id, 
		case when mod(sorted_score_order,3) then 0 end as weak_label,
		count() over (order by sorted_score_asc_order ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND current row) as cum_count
from (
      		select
      		row_number() over (order by scores) as scores_asc_order,
