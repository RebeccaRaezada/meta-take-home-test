Ans: 
    find . -type f -mtime -30 -ls | grep txt

This cmd can be explained as follows:
find . --> this will look for files in current folder
-type f --> this will only look for files not folders/subfolder
-mtime -30 -->this will set the timeframe of files from last 30 days only
-ls --> will list all such files
grep txt --> will only show text files
